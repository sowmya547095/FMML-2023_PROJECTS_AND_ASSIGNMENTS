        "Here's how the number of iterations affects the estimate in cross-validation:\n",
        "\n",
        "More Iterations, Better Estimate: Increasing the number of iterations in cross-validation (e.g., going from 3-fold to 5-fold or 10-fold) typically provides a more accurate and reliable estimate of a model's performance. This is because you are using more diverse subsets of your data for training and validation, reducing the impact of randomness and variability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Computational Cost: While increasing the number of iterations can improve the estimate's accuracy, it also increases the computational cost. Each additional fold requires training and evaluating the model multiple times, which can be time-consuming, especially for large datasets or complex models.\n",

Going from a 3-fold cross-validation to a 10-fold cross-validation might improve the estimate, but the improvement may be relatively small compared to the increase in computational resources required.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bias-Variance Trade-off: In very small datasets, using a high number of folds can lead to high variance in the estimates because each fold contains very little data. Conversely, in very large datasets, you can often use more folds without significantly increasing the computational cost, leading to more stable estimates."
